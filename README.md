# tidyverse_to_pandas
Currently going through an entire re-write/re-base. 

Essentially, back-end was a hodge-podge of spaghetti code that "worked" but not well. Additionally, recent changes to tidyr meant that creating new functions 
to mimic functionality was more difficult than it needed to be, due to lack of common software principles such as Single Responsibility. 

So I'm currently re-writing the entire back-end to better mimic tidyr syntax, as well as make it much easier to create new functions.
